# Java Projects

This repository contains a collection of Java projects that I have created for personal learning and understanding of the programming language.  
Each project is designed to demonstrate different programming concepts and techniques, and each has its own subdirectory and README file that provides an overview of the project, as well as instructions for building and running the code.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/java-projects.git`
2. Navigate to the directory of the project you want to build: `cd java-projects/project-name`
3. Build the project by running `javac *.java` in the project directory
4. Run the project using the following command: `java MainClass`

## Requirements
